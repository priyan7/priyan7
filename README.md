- FPGA-based Real-Time Image Processing  
- Embedded Programming with STM32  
- Hardware-Software Co-Design  

---

### 🌱 I’m currently learning:
- Full-Custom IC Layout & Simulation (Cadence Virtuoso)  
- Advanced C Programming (Memory Mgmt, File I/O)  
- Verilog for RTL Design & Simulation  
- Sigma-Delta ADC Design on 90nm CMOS

---

### 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on:
- Analog/DSP-based academic or open-source hardware projects  
- Low-power system designs  
- Real-time signal/image processing applications  
- Research projects in analog/RF circuit design
